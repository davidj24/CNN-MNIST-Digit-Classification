This is a quick project I did after first learning about Convolutional Nerual Networks and how to implement them using Tensorflow and Keras.
Though a bit overboardfor the task, I used TensorFlow to create a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset resulting in 99.23% sparse categorical accuracy and .026 sparse cagtegorical crossentropy when evaluated on the MNIST test set.
